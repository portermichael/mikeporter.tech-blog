&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Shows Today is the cure for the boring afternoon. It is an Alexa skill that gives shows and events available in US cities via voice commands.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Local Shows Today](https://www.amazon.com/MikePorter-Local-Shows-Today/dp/B0746F5QHF/) is deployed to the Amazon Store.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Shows Today was built during the one day “Hack the Now and Next’ hosted at Ratio in Seattle. Having built only a biology quiz application, it was quite the change of pace. But we succeeded in generating a product, a plan and implementing it in one day. We placed second and received echo dots! Pretty sweet!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built with Node.js and superagent to make API calls to the Ticketmaster API, Local Shows Today works for over 10,000 US cities. Simply begin the phrase 'Alexa, Local Shows Today for' and say the city 'San Diego'.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has spent more time on it after the hackathon, but we think it's an interesting niche that hasn't been fulfilled well and has some potential for spontaneous activities!
