&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trivia Ninja is the solution to sharpening the ninja mind. With over 3000 unique questions, multiple difficulties and a freeplay mode, a ninja can keep their most valuable tool well trained and ready for action!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Trivia Ninja](https://trivia-ninja.herokuapp.com/){:target='_blank'} is deployed on Heroku. (Dynos may take a few moments to spin up!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trivia Ninja is a single page Javascript web app built mobile first as a group project. Questions are generated utilizing AJAX calls to a very friendly public [API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Routing is handled with Node.js/Page.js. High Scores persistence is maintained via postgreSQL.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project took about three and a half days. It focused on applying the skills we learned in the previous month towards building a practical application at Code Fellows. The first day was spent planning heavily. Detailing all the aspects we could think of. Initial MVP was completed on day two. I spent day three building the Free Play functionality as a stretch goal and the final day was spent polishing the CSS.
