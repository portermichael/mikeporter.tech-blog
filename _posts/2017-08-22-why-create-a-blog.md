&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A professional blog is a career investment. When I first started developing I didn't see the point of a blog for someone new like me. I thought it was a tool for advanced programmers to give back to the community. How could I, some new person, give back to the community. As I've become more experienced, it's become clear that every developer should write to have some published knowledge.

### The Soft-Clock

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software positions have a  preference for folks who enjoy programming in their off-time. We should strive to maintain a good work life balance, but great people in their field are involved in and think about their work off the clock too.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can call this idea a soft-clock. We aren't in the zone "working", but it's around us. The soft-clock is like networking at a MeetUp, thinking about a problem while mowing the lawn or creating a blog. We're advancing our careers by investing time in the field, but it's not necessarily for whom we currently work for.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft-clock is not taking a work call while playing with your kids. That's real work, and we need a life outside of work. That said we need a life outside the soft-clock too! Make sure you have time for yourself, your friends and your family.

### Measuring Stick and Personal Reference

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A technical blog demonstrates a certain level of technical competence. If we start early enough and maintain consistency a technical blog can be an accurate list of the skills we've learned. A sort of check-box of abilities that anyone can look at.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the writer, we also have a personal reference for skills written in our own words. An easy use catalog of how to do something we might have forgotten a step in or haven't handled in a few months.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's true what they say. You don't really understand something unless you can explain it to someone else. So get out there and write posts on the concepts you already know, or even attempt to write out the concepts you don't know to find some understanding faults. Worst case scenario, if you want to review something, you can fall back on your own personal body of work and see it again in your own words.
