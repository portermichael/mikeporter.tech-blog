When I first started developing I didn't see the point of a blog for someone new like me. I thought it was a tool for advanced programmers to give back to the community and get their name out there for headhunters. As I've become more experienced, it's become clear that every developer should write to have some published measuring stick knowledge.

### The Soft-Clock

When I started exploring software positions, I began seeing preferences towards individuals with personal websites and blogs. Software job postings often call for folks who enjoy programming in their off-time. We should strive to maintain a good work life balance, but someone great in their field is involved in and thinks about their field off the clock too.

We can call this idea a soft-clock, where we aren't really "working", but it's around us. The soft-clock is like going to a MeetUp with decent food and drinks or thinking a problem while making dinner. We're around work, but not actively involved in it.

The soft-clock is not taking a work call while playing with your kids. That's real work, and we need a life outside of work.

### Measuring Stick and Personal Reference

A technical blog demonstrates a certain level of technical competence. If we start early enough and maintain consistency a technical blog can be an accurate list of the skills we've learned. A sort of check-box of abilities that anyone can look at.

For the writer, we also have a personal reference for skills written in our own words. An easy use catalog of how to do something we might have forgotten a step in or haven't handled in a few months.

It's true what they say. You don't really understand something unless you can explain it to someone else. So get out there and write posts on the concepts you already know, or even attempt to write out the concepts you don't know to find your faults. Worst case scenario, if you want to review something, you can fall back on your own personal body of work and see it again in your own words.
