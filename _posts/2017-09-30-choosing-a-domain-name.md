&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing a great domain name is one of the most annoying and difficult parts of web development. A great domain name is short, memorable, expresses the web apps functionality, and is available!

### Choosing Your Domain Name

#### Brainstorming Words

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in choosing a domain name is brainstorming a collection of words, ideas or concepts that express the functionality of the web app. For example, if I were building an app with an educational focus I might start with school and education. Those two words are probably not available anywhere, but it's a good starting point.

#### Expand Brainstorming with a Thesaurus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got a focus, but no real good words yet. I like to browse the [thesaurus](http://www.thesaurus.com/){:target='_blank'} to help expand my list. I'll input school, browse the similar words and record words or concepts I like. I will take those additional words and browse those in the thesaurus too. My goal here is to find phrases or concepts that represent my educational focus, are short, and are easy to spell. After doing this for a while, I might add 10-15 words that fit.

#### Get an Idea of What Words are Available

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got a list of solid words, some of which might be available. But we have to check what is available! I like to use [Panabee](www.panabee.com){:target='_blank'} at this step. It searches a word or combination of words and does a bit of word play like replacing e's with i's, and about 30 other 'tricks'. Based on the search results, we can get an idea of how sought after our word or combination is. We can use the search results to expand our brainstorming a bit too!

### Choose A Domain Level

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we've got a list of words, and an ideal of our availability, we can choose a domain level. Are Top Level Domains available? Do we have money to invest in this business venture? Is this our first dive into web development?

#### Top Level Domains or Not?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TLDs (Top Level Domains) include .com, .net and .org. They were the first domains available and the most easily marketable, memorable and familiar. TLDs also have the fewest name choices. A lot of two word combinations, and marketable phrases have been bought and are being held or used by people and companies. I couldn't get mikeporter.com in 2017. Another Mike Porter has it, but I could get mikeporter.tech.

#### Alternatives to TLDs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatives to TLDs are available, and often for less than a dollar a piece. They can be checked, often 50 or so at a time, at all the domain name services, including: [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/){:target='_blank'}, [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/){:target='_blank'}, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target='_blank'}, [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns/){:target='_blank'} and [Google Domains](https://domains.google/){:target='_blank'}.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought mikeporter.tech for 88c. Although on name cheap it will jump to $40 next year. That's 3x more than the $10-15 I would expect to renew a TLD. So, while we can definitely expect a cheaper initial cost for an alternative, there is a bit of price gouging afterwards. My intention is to transfer this domain to a cheaper alternative next year, and see if I can get a $15 dollar renewal.

#### .io

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.io's have been a popular alternative to TLD's for start ups. Unfortunately, they also suffer from the same situation my .tech account suffers from, and they cost ~$30 a year. In the grand scheme very affordable, but 20 bucks is 20 bucks.

#### Registering an Open Domain

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing a great open TLD is a difficult process, but I shared with you what I did, and I've had some choices I'm very happy with. Exercising your creativity along with a good understanding of what "types" of names are still available is the real key.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While choosing a great name is difficult, registering a name is incredibly easy. Some DNRs (domain name registrars) even offer $.99 for your first domain name. A few big DNRs are [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/){:target='_blank'}, [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/){:target='_blank'}, [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target='_blank'}, [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/dns/){:target='_blank'} and [Google Domains](https://domains.google/){:target='_blank'}.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These DNRs also provide hosting services. It is easy to host on their service, but Amazon Web Services, Google Domains and Microsoft Azure have the cheapest and easiest hosting to upgrade. AWS, Azure and Google Domains both charge about $12 for registration, while GoDaddy and NameCheap charge anywhere from $.99 to $11.99.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be noted that GoDaddy has a reputation for trying to up-sell services. You will often get emails advertising 20-30% off your next registration and other advertisements. But I've been skeptical of them ever since this [article](https://medium.com/@N/how-i-lost-my-50-000-twitter-username-24eb09e026dd){:target='_blank'} came out. My concern is that this social engineering issue is endemic in the company and I do not recommend them. That's excluding their past of overly sexual commercials for buying domain names.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Namecheap used to be much cheaper than GoDaddy, with regard to hosting, but they are now about on par in terms of cost. Namecheap does not send you nearly as much in terms of email advertisements, and hasn't had the same bad PR.

#### Registering and Hosting With Different Providers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally, feel most comfortable registering my domain name and hosting with different providers. I prefer having specialized businesses doing what they do with a focus on the product I'm using in the long term. I also prefer separating how many businesses control aspects I depend on. Should NameCheap have an issue with my specific domain name, I know it will affect their primary business focus and that I have some leverage should I be treated unjustly. If I have the same issue with Amazon, I don't feel that I have as much leverage. But AWS is a major aspect of Amazon's business model, so I do feel more comfortable there. This is just personal preference, take it with a grain of salt.

#### Buying a Squatted Domain

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of domains are held in the hopes someone will buy them. You can find out who owns it, and send them an email with your story and an offer. Sometimes you'll get lucky, ...other times it will cost thousands. There are numerous businesses built entirely around this process of buying and selling beyond the scope of this post.
