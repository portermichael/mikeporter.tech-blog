&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Badlib is a madlib constructed to test into Code Fellows in May 2017. Very simple to meet the required specifications. Namely, generating code I can talk about.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Badlib](https://portermichael.github.io/badlibs/index.html) is deployed on Github pages.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built in Javascript with local storage to maintain persistence. No bells and whistles. There are no bonus points for spending time on a project that doesn't net any additional value.
