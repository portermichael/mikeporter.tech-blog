&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Hired Code Fellows](https://hired-codefellows.herokuapp.com/) is deployed on Heroku. (Front-end and Back-end dynos may take a few moments to spin up!)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hired Code Fellows is a Full Stack Unbiased Resume application completed as a capstone project at Code Fellows. Built with a backend in Express.js. Hired uses a cached CSV file to send JSON to a React.js and Redux based front-end. After selecting students, the user fills out a simple email form that gets sent to the backend, and sends an email the user and Code Fellows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having written the majority of the back-end project, [Goat Fellows]({{ '/goat-fellows' | absolute_url}}), I wanted to spend time developing my front-end skills a bit more. I wrote or coached someone through the vast majority of the front-end and later entirely re-wrote the SCSS.
