&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been a Research Biologist in one way or another for the past 8-10 years or so. I started learning to code in graduate school by taking Harvard's famous CS:50, (I highly recommend it for new leaners), and continued learning for a few years while working. Hands down, I wanted to be a developer to make more money in an easier physical environment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't a knock on Research Biology. It's this crazy field that is part knowledge, part good hands and part time management. But because it requires good hands, it requires a lot of physical presence. Sometimes that presence is cool experiments, sometimes handling animals, and sometimes it's exposure to chemicals, carcinogens or radiation, (not at unsafe levels, but exposure nonetheless).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to it, I began by learning to code by knocking out tutorials. A lot of them claim 'Learn Javascript, or Ruby or X in 15 minutes.' Yeah, great tagline, but you are just going through their motions. We aren't really learning. Learning takes time, and directed effort. I learned a bit during this time, but I was very much plug and play status.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truthfully, teaching myself to code was much more difficult than I anticipated. On top of my previous issues, I spent a lot of time designing features and thinking about little aspects of improvement, instead of actually developing products. This is a major bog down for start ups and I can see and understand why.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am smart enough, I trust myself enough, and I do well in a structured school environment, so I joined a coding bootcamp. For me it was a great experience at building a strong foundation. I tested into the middle of the bootcamp and although initially struggled, I finished very strong. It was like I had the scaffolding for a building ready, but I had to go in and pour the foundation afterwards. Initially it was very difficult, but once completed I could see a much bigger and larger picture than many of my classmates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the skills I learned in graduate school focused on time management, I feel like a strong programmer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes ask my more experienced peers what they felt they've learned or how they've grown over the years. The answer is often they can see the issues and complexities with code quickly. That is they can imagine the pieces coming together in multiple ways, and where the bottlenecks or problems will live. So that's my next step, getting to a higher coding perception level and getting faster. Getting more experience.
