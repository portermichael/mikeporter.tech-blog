&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been a research biologist for the past 8 years or so, working with Zebrafish, mice, hamsters, and cell culture. I started learning to code independently as it came up in graduate school and started to put more of a dedicated focus as I was ending. I continued coding and was able to bring the skills I learned and merged them with biology data analysis improving efficiency and adding some automation.

One thing that I found while learning independently, was that it was difficult to find beginner information. It was hard to get from step zero to step one, so... this is a blog dedicated to beginners.

For those of you at step zero, take Harvards CS:50 as your first intro to programming course.
