My name is Michael Porter. I've been a Research Biologist in one way or another for the past 10 years or so. I started learning to code in graduate school by taking an online intro course, and continued learning after graduating adn finding work. I wanted to be a developer. Today I am a full stack web developer. My best language is Javascript, but I can code in Ruby/RoR too.


I began by doign a lot of tutorials. A LOT of tutorials. All these tutorials that claim to teach you Javascript, or Ruby or whatever in 15 minutes. Yeah, great tagline.

Learning a language takes time. It takes time, effort and dedication to learn. I learned a bit during this time, but I was very much plugin and play. I didn't understand code after tutorials, so I took a free online course. Only, I didn't sit there and code out every assignment. My first one took me 8 hours, so I just listened to all the lectures and studied the material.

I would not recommend that learning method. I half learned the material when the foundation is the most important part!

Truthfully, teaching myself to code was much more difficult than I anticipated. On top of my previous issues, I spent a lot of time designing and thinking about little aspects of improvement, instead of actually sitting down and coding.

But I am smart. I trust myself. And I do well in a structured school environment. So I joined a coding bootcamp.



I've assembled a handful of sites, read hundreds of blog articles and designed some games during this time. I moved to Seattle and wanted to continue coding as means to create a business. I wasn't sure how my skills fit in, and I have hardly coded with anyone else - which is a load of problems in itself - so I wanted to try codefellows, where I could gain an understanding of both!
